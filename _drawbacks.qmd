# Disadvantages
:::{.callout-note}
There is a trade-off between time invested upfront (learning $\LaTeX$ etc. vs. and time saved in the long-run.
:::

It takes time to learn (Overleaf and other more relevant UI etc. make it easier)

It can be very fiddly (if you want specifics with tables, or placing images)

Collaboration features are quite limited out of the box

Plugins such as Grammarly don't work ootb, for VSCode, you can integrate these as an Extension, on Overleaf there is a [buggy workaround](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Use_Grammarly_with_Overleaf)

It can be fragile to set up, especially if using a lot of packages/features - i.e.: don't use what you don't need

## Tables
Tables can be fiddly, and a lot of work to enter manually.

```latex {code-line-numbers="false"}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
 cell1 & cell2 & cell3 \\ 
 cell4 & cell5 & cell6 \\  
 cell7 & cell8 & cell9    
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
```

There are tools to help with this: [TablesGenerator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/) or [LaTeXTables](https://www.latex-tables.com/)
