  abstract = {For decades, scholars have predicted that videoconference technology will disrupt the practice of commuting daily to and from work and will change the way people socialize. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced a drastic increase in the number of videoconference meetings, and Zoom became the leading software package because it was free, robust, and easy to use. While the software has been an essential tool for productivity, learning, and social interaction, something about being on videoconference all day seems particularly exhausting, and the term “Zoom Fatigue” caught on quickly. In this article, I focus on nonverbal overload as a potential cause for fatigue, and provide four arguments outlining how various aspects of the current Zoom interface likely lead to psychological consequences. The arguments are based on academic theory and research, but also have yet to be directly tested in the context of Zoom, and require future experimentation to confirm. Instead of indicting the medium, my goal is to point out these design flaws to isolate research areas for social scientists and to suggest design improvements for technologists.},

  abstract = {Long class periods are physically and intellectually exhausting for both students and instructors in the physical world. When that practice is applied to the digital world, things become much more difficult. When instructors teach online, many teachers discover that their synchronous Zoom lessons go on for far longer than expected. Participating in such lengthy video calls may be stressful for instructors and students. Video calls often demand more attention than in-person talks do because users have a much more restricted view of non-verbal cues, such as body movements. This makes it more difficult to absorb the information being sent. This research purposes the hypothesis of inverted U-shape trajectories in online classes. \&nbsp;It is postulated that there is an ideal length of online classes. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not this hypothesis is correct and to determine the length of an online class of material posting that is ideal for use on social media platforms. The implementation of many quadratic longitudinal models has taken place. The dataset includes the length and student engagement scores and teacher satisfaction. Data are on a weekly basis for five different schools, totaling 525 samples of longitudinal datasets. These data confirm our hypothesis that increasing the duration of an online class increases student engagement and instructor satisfaction up to a certain length. However, both students' engagement and instructors' satisfaction suffer if online class sessions are made longer.},

  abstract = {“Zoom fatigue”—theorized here as part of a larger experience with computer-mediated communication (CMC) exhaustion—has emerged as a common negative experience through prolonged use of CMC platforms. Despite CMC exhaustion’s ubiquity, the relatively novel phenomenon has caused much speculation for its root causes with little information pinpointing why it occurs. Utilizing research, observations, and personal accounts, this article explores synchronous online consultations (SOCs) within writing centers as matching sites to ponder the basis for CMC exhaustion. In doing so, third skins are proposed to account for how nuanced differences in space between SOCs and face-to-face exchanges mean participants are not engaged as human actors but “flattened” into a totality of third skin comprising person, background, and technology. The resulting transformation and our bodies exerting substantial cognitive efforts to interact with this transformation are theorized to produce CMC exhaustion. The implications for this are twofold: 1) for readers interested in the underlying causes of CMC exhaustion, this work presents a framework to test the ideas proposed and develop mitigating strategies, and 2) for readers who study SOCs, third skins might explain previously observed limitations in the effectiveness of visuality in CMC.},

  abstract = {Although higher education institutes were the early adopters of remote learning through virtual, synchronous classrooms during the pandemic, the efficacy of this medium has received mixed reactions. Engaging online learners still remains a major challenge for instructors and institutions in general. Amidst variety of distractions at home, achieving positive learning outcomes and student engagement during the class is imperative for a quality learning experience. Achieving the same level of success with online learning requires overcoming the barriers of the modality while promoting collaboration, discussion and engagement, which encapsulate the essence of a great learning ecosystem. This demands our attention to acquire a comprehensive understanding of student engagement with online learning. Hence, the present chapter aims to provide a holistic view of student engagement from a stakeholders’ perspective. The framework offers practical and actionable insights into the key stakeholders in enhancing students’ engagement and offering quality online education during and post pandemic periods.},

  abstract = {This paper explores plausible reasons why some students report having more difficulty learning online, predominantly in Zoom synchronous classes, and suggests strategies that students can do to optimize their learning.~ During anonymous classroom observations, approximately 80\% of 350 college students polled indicated it was harder to focus their attention and stay present while taking classes online.~ They also reported experiencing more isolation, anxiety, and depression compared to face-to-face classes, although much of this may be due to COVID-19 social isolation.~ Students often appear nonresponsive when attending online synchronous Zoom classes that negatively impacts the nonverbal dynamics of student–instructor interactions. ~Communication issues includes internet challenges, lack of facial expressions, body appearance, and movement. ~Students also report that it is more challenging to maintain attention, especially when they are multitasking. ~Suggested strategies are to optimize learning that includes arranging the camera so that you are visible, using active facial and body responses as if you are communicating to just one person face-to-face, configuring your body and environment (sitting upright and creating unique cues for each specific task), reducing multitasking and notifications, and optimizing arousal and vision regeneration.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE The aim is to study the effectiveness of using Zoom technology to offer evening tutorial sessions to improve the success of students studying foundation engineering units by distance mode at a regional university, while maintaining a manageable workload for academics. APPROACH A course Moodle site gives information about the learning behaviors of students. For example, data can be collected on how many students watched a lecture or the most frequently watched parts of lectures. In this study, student engagement with the course was measured by closely observing the number and types of posts to the Q\&A Forum on the Moodle site for the years 2016 and 2017 and the number of students attending Zoom virtual tutorials when introduced in 2017. RESULTS Data collected from the Moodle site over the 2016 and 2017 course offerings showed levels of engagement were maintained with the learning resources (Q\&A Forum in 2016 and additionally the Zoom virtual tutorials in 2017). Also, a similar response rate was recorded for the course evaluation questionnaire but satisfaction scores improved in many areas. The introduction of Zoom virtual tutorials resulted in higher student satisfaction and a reduction in instructor workload of approximately 25\%. CONCLUSIONS By offering online Zoom tutoring sessions, the number of questions and answers posted on the Moodle has reduced significantly and reduced the workload of academics. This has been achieved without reducing the engagement levels of students or altering the grade distribution.},
