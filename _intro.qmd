# What is $\LaTeX$?
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="70%"}
Pronounciation: /ˈlɑːtɛk/ or /ˈleɪtɛk/ 

$\LaTeX$ is a typesetting system and has been around since 1984

A markup language like HTML or Markdown

Can be hard to get started, but is becoming more and more accessible

Think of it as combining **content** with **programming** to control how that content should be displayed

Getting the actual output (often a pdf) requires compilation

<!-- The name TeX is intended by its developer to be $\tau \epsilon \chi$, TeX is an abbreviation of τέχνη (ΤΕΧΝΗ technē), Greek for both "art" and "craft", which is also the root word of technical. -->

## What you see...

### WYSIWYM
Latex, Markdown, HTML and other formats are "What you see is what you mean"

Seperates content from presentation

Harder to learn, more powerful, and more control over presentation

Can automate a lot of tedious work

Collaboration tools more recent (e.g.: Overleaf)

### WYSIWYG
Most word processors (Word, Google Docs, etc.) are "What you see is what you get"

More intuitive to use, more interactive

Much less powerful, fiddly to get right, and can involve a lot of tedious work

Have had better collaboration tools (i.e.: comments, track changes, suggest mode)

<!-- ## Alternatives
- the ususal suspects: Microsoft Word, Google Doc, Libre/Open/... Office
  - these are wysiwyg (what you see is what you get)/gui-based, point, click, change. 
  - their benefits are usually that many not-so-techy people use them and can colleaborate
  - some things are quite efficient (Tables, for examples, but we'll provide you with some neat workarounds) especially the tracking of changes in MSWord and placing images. Yes, if you want to mock up a layout point-and-click it usually a lot quicker -->
