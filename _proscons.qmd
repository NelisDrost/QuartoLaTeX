# Why use $\LaTeX$
It separates **content** from **formatting**, letting you focus on each individually

Long history and wide community of users - there are plenty of examples, templates, packages, and answers to questions you might have on how to do what you need.

Opens up several other tools, e.g.: quarto, pandocs

**Cross-platform** compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, ...)

 Most of the (good) books, journal articles, etc. are created using $\LaTeX$ 

Free and not tied to any big corporation, you can often write in any text editor, browser etc. 

## Seperate content & presentation
- $\LaTeX$ allows you to write content now and worry about formatting later
- You still need to specify structure by inserting e.g.: **\section**, **\begin{figure}**, **\begin{tabular}**, **\centering**, etc.
    - You don't need to worry about how those will look until later
- When you do alter the formatting, it effects the whole document - no need to individually change the numbering system of every figure/table/equation (e.g.: $1a, 1b \rightarrow 1.1, 1.2$)
- Allows potential re-use with tools like _pandoc_ to produe different outputs


## Advantages
Looks great by default, but gives a great deal of control layout and format

- it decides where pictures are placed
- maths is neatly rendered
- how line-breaks happen
- multi-column layouts on one page

Content is in plain text files

- can be fed into all sorts of useful tools
- no proprietary software that 
  - might disappear from the market
  - charges you for a subscription model
- you can keep this compeltely offline/local/no-cloud, etc. good for Ethics Approvals and sensitive data
- even if you don't have the software to compile a document, you can still extract the content

## Advantages - continued
Inline comments (for future you, for your supervisor, to toggle things on/off)
```latex {code-line-numbers="false"}
\section{Literature review}
The use of markup languages for document preperation has a long history...
% TODO - actually review the literature!
```

Symbols often render very neatly, sometimes workarounds are needed

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
```latex
M\={a}ori 
```
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
M훮ori
:::
::::

For Macrons [a more advanced approach is described here](https://jevonsnotes.wordpress.com/2013/03/22/maori-macrons-and-latex/), as Unicode is mostly used, you can type M훮ori (so on a Mac use the long-press option 훮 to write M훮ori or change the keyboard style) or copy-paste such characters. 

Non-latin alphabets take more work, but can be achieved with packages such as _XeLaTex_
