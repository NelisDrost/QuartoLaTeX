# Pain points $\LaTeX$ fixes
## Breaking changes
Some things are possible in traditional word-processors, but hard and/or fragile.

Many points-of-no-return, where you either implement a fragile solution that will break if other things change, or switch off some of the automated formatting done by the word processor.


## Seperate content & formatting
- $\LaTeX$ allows you to write content now and worry about formatting later
- You still need to specify structure by inserting e.g.: **\section**, **\begin{figure}**, **\begin{tabular}**, **\centering**, etc.
    - You don't need to worry about how those will look until later
- When you do alter the formatting, it effects the whole document - no need to individually change the numbering system of every figure/table/equation (e.g.: $1a, 1b \rightarrow 1.1, 1.2$)

## Floating figures
- Figures (and optionally any other content) in $\LaTeX$ float, which means that they are inserted where they fit best, e.g.: in between paragraphs, on a page where that won't leave an awkward gap, or on their own pages
- You can exert control over these options, prefering _here_, the _top_ or _bottom_ of a page, or on a float only _page_
- This is especially powerful as you add/remove figures and text, as they generally float to somewhere that looks good, rather than needing to manually move figures between pages when changing content

## Updating figures
- Figures (also [tables from csv](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/146716/importing-csv-file-into-latex-as-a-table), and citations from BibTeX) are loaded from a file when you build the document (e.g.: $./figures/my_plot.png$)
- This means that if the content of the target file changes, so will the figure in the output document when it is built
- This is especially useful if you generate figures from code - you can change the figure format in code, regenerate all your figures, then build the $\LaTeX$ document to see all the changes
- This saves you manually inserting each figure every time it changes

## Internal links
- You can place tags on almost any element in $\LaTeX$ (e.g.: a _section_, _figure_, _table_, _equation_, _footnote_ etc.)
- These can then be reference from anywhere else in the document, either pointing directly to that element (**equation 3.1**) or to the page that element is on (**page 26**)
- These links are made at build time, so if you add more equations, those links may change to **equation 3.2** on **page 27** automatically
- Some word processors have a similar feature, but they are famously brittle
- This also works for automatic generation of tables of contents, tables of figures, etc.
- This links are clickable in most PDF readers
- Citations can also be linked to by short form **(Smith et. al, 2000)**, author (**Smith et al.** wrote...), year (previous work done in **2000**), etc. all of which are clickable

```latex
\section{Test}\label{sec:test}
Some text
\begin{equation}
  e = m c^2
  \label{eqn:emc}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Discussion}
As we can see in Equation \ref{eqn:emc} in Section \ref{sec:test}...

## Version control
- $\LaTeX$ files are plain text, which means that they work well with version control tools such as [Github](https://www.github.com)
  - This also gives access to additional tools such as _diff_, _branches_ and _pull requests_ for collaboration
- Using version control gives you a complete history of the state of your document, allowing you to recover old versions, or compare them to the current state
- That complete history gives the **confidence** to make more drastic changes
